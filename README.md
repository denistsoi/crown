This year, intelligence agency [GCHQ.gov](http://www.gchq.gov.uk/press_and_media/news_and_features/Pages/Directors-Christmas-puzzle-2015.aspx) released a Christmas puzzle, whereby the first part was essentially a QR code nonogram ![image of Nonogram](http://www.gchq.gov.uk/SiteCollectionImages/grid-shading-puzzle-lowres.jpg). 

The resulting image lead the solver to this page below.

This small program attempts to resolve the multiple choice puzzle by brute forcing each end point and determining which of the codes is different to the failed Message.

The resulting destination is [here](http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/puzzleinabucket/DEFACE.html)
which redirects the user to Part 3 of the problem series [here](http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/puzzleinabucket/bb1f263f70e45b3d.html).
